After going through security passport control, passengers and airport staff will be able to purchase stuff at the new stores before their flight. After doing some shopping, the boarding gates wait ahead. There are now 18 gates, which were 8 before the redevelopment. For this reason, the walkaway installed between the gates has been replaced for a sky train, which will be able to transport people along the different gates. But if you're not leaving the South West airport, you'll be glad to know the arrivals area has also been redeveloped. After going through passport control customs, passengers and airport staff will be able to hire different services.

As for the number of visitors staying on island, there was no progress of increase or decrease in the first two years which are 2010 and 2011 but the graph rose until it remained constant for three consecutive years in a row. The number of visitors then slacked off in the year 2016, but managed to increase to the same level as the year before the previous in 2017. All in all, the graph showed an outstanding performance for the total number of visitors throughout 2011 to 2017, where it increased gradually every single year except from 2015 to 2016 where it remained constant."

However, the rating could be improved by providing data in $ billions for earnings for each product (not just engineered goods and textiles). One of the comments is debatable [This statistic also conclude that the engineers in the country have gained more by the year 2016]. Organisation follows the order of the bar chart, providing an overall progression, and there is some use of cohesive devices to signal a change of topic. The vocabulary used provides some variety of expression [differ | gained | decreased], even if it is not always appropriate [money-making / profitable | textures / textiles]. Errors occur [earning(s) | foot step / footstep | stills], but the intended meaning is clear. The candidate uses both simple and complex sentence forms, but better control of both grammar and punctuation might result in a higher rating here."

              "The following plans illustrate the layout of the university's sports centre at the present moment and the way it will look after a reconstruction.",
              "According to the new layout, the redeveloped sports centre is going to become bigger. First, the gym is going to be larger and an additional changing room is going to appear. Besides, there is going to be a sports shop and a cafe in the reception zone. Apart from that, 2 dance studios are going to work opposite the gym. Finally, the sports centre is going to get a new leisure pool. It is going to be located in the place where the outdoor courts used to be. As can be seen from the new layout, both outdoor courts are going to be replaced by other facilities in the renovated sports centre. Furthermore, a sports hall is going to appear in the university sports centre. It is also clear from the second layout that the redeveloped sports centre is going to be a fully indoor one."

            "This answer addresses the main features of the redeveloped sports centre, but it could be improved by adding a brief description of the centre as it is at present. Another aspect of the response that could be improved would be to indicate where the various facilities will be situated in relation to each other: from the description above the reader cannot know where for example the gym, the leisure pool and the dance studios will be located. The range of vocabulary is above average, however: [illustrate | reconstruction | redeveloped | additional | replaced by other facilities | renovated] and shows flexibility and precision. There is a variety of complex structures such as present and future verb forms, passive forms and relative clauses [the place where... | It is also clear... that]. There could be more variety in the language used to express future plans: [going to] is over-used."
